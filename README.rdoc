== Basic usage instructions

Fetch users' contact lists from your web application without asking them to
provide their passwords.

First, register[http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/RegistrationForWebAppsAuto.html]
your application's domain. Then make users follow this URL:

  Contacts::Google.authentication_url('http://mysite.com/invite')

They will authenticate on Google and it will send them back to the URL
provided. Google will add a token GET parameter to the query part of the URL.
Use that token in the next step:

  gmail = Contacts::Google.new(params[:token])
  gmail.contacts
  # => [#<Contact 1>, #<Contact 2>, ...]

The resulting Contacts::Contact objects have `name` and `email` properties.

Read more in Contacts::Google. I plan to support more APIs (Microsoft Live, for
starters); feel free to contribute.

== Dependencies

Please note that you will need to install the json gem if you are not using this gem as part of a Rails project.
